To create the initialisation file, modify lines 5,6 in create_json_initialisation.py:

number_of_sensors = 100 # choose number of sensors to be implemented
number_of actuators = 100 # choose number of actuators to be implemented

To launch the simulation:
python run.py

The server must be already running.
